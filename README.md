# SplitXCIMerger
A simple GUI that merges split XCI files for Linux users
This is a simple GUI that uses Zenity to merge split XCI files from Nintendo Switch Cartridge Dumps.
(Currently only supports .xc files, any assistance for other files would be greatly appreciated!)

**Requirements**

The only thing required is Zenity.

**Instructions**
1. Move all of your .xc files to a seperate directory
2. Allow SplitXCIMerger.sh to execute
3. Run SplitXCIMerger.sh
4. Profit!
